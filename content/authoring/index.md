# Overview

All content available on Codewars is created members of Codewars community. It's ideas of Codewars users what gets turned into kata, and only the fact that users are familiar with plenty of programming languages allows for large amount of available translations.

To support users in creating good quality of kata and translations, a set of help pages was created with articles related to content authoring activities: tutorials explaining how to create and translate a kata, and reference of guidelines and requirements which every author should follow to make sure that a piece of content created by them meets quality criteria.

This section of documentation is meant mostly for authors and translators, who would like to introduce new challenges and make them available for other users. Additionally, reviewers should use [guidelines]() collected here to verify whether the reviewed piece of content meets all quality requirements, as described in documentation related to [curating of content][docs-curating].
