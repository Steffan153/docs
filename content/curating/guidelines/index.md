# Codewars Content Curation Guidelines

_This page is a stub._

## Overview

This set of pages contains guidelines for reviewers to help them establish whether reviewed kata or translations adhere to the community's quality standards.

The guidelines should be used by reviewers to verify whether new content about to be introduced to Codewars is of sufficient quality. Conformity to these guidelines is a prerequisite for approving a kata or translation.

All Codewars content is created by the community and for the community. The community is the only mechanism for enforcing and elevating quality standards. All Codewars users are encouraged to provide suggestions for improving content and reporting or fixing issues.

Since the guidelines were introduced after many kata had been created, older kata may fail to meet the standard of quality. In such cases, beta kata and pending translations should be updated to improve their quality as much as possible before approval. Existing kata, on the other hand, can be approached in a more relaxed way. Obvious bugs and severe issues should be fixed, but otherwise, guidelines can be applied gradually as the kata receives new translations, or as issues are raised and fixed.

:::warning Important note
Reviewers who repeatedly violate or ignore rules and introduce poor-quality content to the system can have their approval privileges revoked and offending content withdrawn.

## General Guidelines

- **Always verify conformity to authoring guidelines when reviewing content.** Know what are quality requirements for kata, translations, descriptions, and code, and make sure they were followed by the author.
- **Keep responsibility for all content you approved.** You should actively maintain all content you introduced into Codewars: fix issues, consider suggestions, answer questions.
- Whenever possible, **improve any content of insufficient quality** by fixing bugs and identifying and addressing usability issues. Leave every kata you visit in better shape than you found it.
- Remember that you can always **ask others for help.**
