# Kata

_This page is a stub._

This article contains a set of guidelines, which can be used by authors to create good, enjoyable, high quality kata. They were collected to help ensure that kata are of sufficient quality and users' experience will be as good as possible.

## General Guidelines

- **Always verify conformity to authoring guidelines when reviewing content.** Know what are quality requirements for kata, translations, descriptions, and code, and make sure they were followed by the author.
- **Keep responsibility for all content you approved.** You should actively maintain all content you introduced into Codewars: fix issues, consider suggestions, answer questions.
- Whenever possible, **improve any content of insufficient quality** by fixing bugs and identifying and addressing usability issues. Leave every kata you visit in better shape than you found it.
- Remember that you can always **ask others for help.** 


## Solving

- TODO: move parts from "Beta Process"
- TODO: Feedback
- If you think the kata itself is valuable but you simply have some issues with it, then you should select "Somewhat" and create an issue instead. If you thought the kata is really great, other than the issues, then you can choose "Very". Please do not choose "None" simply because the kata has an issue but it is otherwise a good kata. The satisfaction rating is meant to indicate quality of kata as a concept, not its current state of condition in terms of open issues which can be fixed.

## Review

- TODO: move parts from "Beta Process"
- verify authoring guidelines
- It's very helpful when such old issues are reviewed and marked as resolved if they are not valid anymore. It can also happen that there are posts in the kata discourse which report some problem, but are not labelled appropriately. It's generally a good idea to re-raise such issues as new posts with the correct label, as it should help other users to find them and eventually fix them.

## Approval

- TODO: move parts from "Beta Process"


## Maintenance

- **You are responsible for your kata.** As long as you're an active Codewars user, you should address quality issues in kata you authored: fix issues, consider suggestions, answer questions.
- **Issues and kata bugs should be fixed.** When for some reason a reported issue is not going to be fixed, clearly explain why. If some issue is reported repeatedly, at least put a note in the description how to work around it. Do not mark valid issues as resolved, leave them for others to fix.
- **It's allowed for a fix to invalidate existing solutions.** Existing solutions should be considered, but also should not be used as an argument for bad quality. If possible, backward compatible fixes are preferred, but it's not necessary if they address a severe bug or a serious problem with the kata. Consider the maturity of the kata and severity of the issue when introducing a fix which is not backwards compatible:
  - For existing kata with thousands of solutions, code style issues (for example name of solution function) probably can wait.
  - For a kata which is still in beta, all solutions can be invalidated if necessary.
