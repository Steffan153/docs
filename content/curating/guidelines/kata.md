## Maintenance

- **You are responsible for your kata.** As long as you're an active Codewars user, you should address quality issues in kata you authored: fix issues, consider suggestions, answer questions.
- **Issues and kata bugs should be fixed.** When for some reason a reported issue is not going to be fixed, clearly explain why. If some issue is reported repeatedly, at least put a note in the description how to work around it. Do not mark valid issues as resolved, leave them for others to fix.
- **It's allowed for a fix to invalidate existing solutions.** Existing solutions should be considered, but also should not be used as an argument for bad quality. If possible, backward compatible fixes are preferred, but it's not necessary if they address a severe bug or a serious problem with the kata. Consider the maturity of the kata and severity of the issue when introducing a fix which is not backwards compatible:
  - For existing kata with thousands of solutions, code style issues (for example name of solution function) probably can wait.
  - For a kata which is still in beta, all solutions can be invalidated if necessary.
